This module provides additional values (dictionaries) that can be used in salary rules. These values are
available to salary rules in two objects called "dictionaries" and "this_contract". The values under
"dictionaries" are calculated once during payslip processing. The values under "this_contract" are
calculated just before each contract in the payslip is processed.
